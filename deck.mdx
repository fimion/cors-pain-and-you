# What is CORS?

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

```
An HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to
indicate any other origins (domain, protocol, or port)
than its own from which a browser should permit loading
of resources.
```

# Great, but what about CORS?

# Types of CORS Requests

- Simple GET and POST XMLHttpRequests/fetch (no preflight)
- Complex XMLHttpRequests/fetch (required preflight)

## What is a Simple CORS Request?

 - No event listeners are registered on any XMLHttpRequestUpload object used in the request
 - No ReadableStream object is used in the request.

---

## What is a Simple CORS Request?

As long as the HTTP **response** contains an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with a value that matches
the **request** `Origin` header, a simple request will go through.

The browser will stop anything from working that does not fit.

### How does a Preflight request work?

#  "`Access-Control-*`" (CORS) Headers

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin
Access-Control-Expose-Headers
Access-Control-Max-Age
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
Access-Control-Allow-Methods
Access-Control-Allow-Headers
```

---

## Access-Control-Allow-Origin

Specifies the request Origin(s) allowed by the server.<br /> You can allow all by using `*` as the value.

Example:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://mozilla.org
Vary: Origin
```

---

## Access-Control-Expose-Headers

Lets a server whitelist headers that Javascript<br /> (such as `getResponseHeader()`) in browsers are allowed to access.

Example:

`Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-Custom-Header, X-Custom-Header-2`

---

## Access-Control-Max-Age

Indicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached in seconds.

Example:

`Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600`

---

## Access-Control-Allow-Credentials

Indicates whether or not the response to the request<br />
can be exposed when the credentials flag is true.<br />
When used as part of a response to a preflight request,<br />
this indicates whether the actual request can be made using credentials.

---

## Access-Control-Allow-Methods

Specifies the method or methods allowed when accessing<br />
the resource. This is used in response to a preflight request.

---

## Access-Control-Allow-Headers

is used in response to a preflight request to indicate which<br />
HTTP headers can be used when making the actual request.
